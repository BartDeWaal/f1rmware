"make build" makes sure hat all requisites are built

"make" prepares everything for flashing

This needs mcopy from mtools. On arch: `pacman -S mtools`

"./FLASHgui" is the flash utility. Will probably need to run as root

This needs a patched dfu-util built from rad1o/dfu-util:

Quick build instructions for dfu-util:

    git clone https://github.com/rad1o/dfu-util.git
    cd dfu-util 
    sh autogen.sh 
    ./configure  
    make
    # install in-place of existing dfu-util
    sudo cp src/dfu-util `which dfu-util`
